# Best Practices Overview

To keep code consistent, maintainable, and scalable—and to give both developers and AI-assisted tools clear guidance for faster onboarding—this section summarizes the best practices for the Perigon project. Use the links below to quickly find what you need:

- [Development-Conventions](Development-Conventions.md): Project settings, entity modeling rules, naming, and API style to keep the fundamentals aligned.
- [Constants-Definition](Constants-Definition.md): How to organize shared and module-specific constants, plus ways to extend `AppConst` safely.
- [Database](Database.md): Recommendations on database choices, schema design, migrations, and working with multiple databases.
- [Manager-Business-Logic](Manager-Business-Logic.md): The role of Managers, how to use the base classes, and patterns to avoid code bloat.
- [Controller-APIs](Controller-APIs.md): What controllers should and should not do, with emphasis on HTTP semantics and error handling.
