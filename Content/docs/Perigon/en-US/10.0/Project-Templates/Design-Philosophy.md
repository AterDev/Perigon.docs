# Design Philosophy

Result-oriented, practical as the goal, in architectural design, pursuing **universal, concise, flexible**, committed to providing developers with efficient and easy-to-use development experiences.

- Universal: Refers to using mainstream, official, widely adopted or recognized technology stacks and implementation methods as much as possible to avoid unnecessary learning costs.
- Concise: Simple and fast. Refers to keeping code and structure simple, fast to use. Minimize mental burden as much as possible, avoid over-design and unnecessary abstraction. Focus on business logic implementation, reduce repetitive code content.
- Flexible: We provide conventions and best practices on the basis of universality and simplicity. This is non-invasive. Since we do not target certain design patterns or development habits, developers do not need to be restricted by them.

> [!NOTE]
> Any design pattern is not our goal, but they are all means to achieve our goal.

## Practices to Avoid

In the design and implementation process, the following practices are not adopted by us:

- Based on one or several design patterns, determine the project structure and technology stack.
- Over-abstraction, increase complexity, reduce development experience.
- Over-encapsulation, reduce flexibility, increase learning and maintenance costs.
- Special encapsulation of third-party packages, no longer universal, increase mental burden.
